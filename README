NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Highlander - There can be only one

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        # in dist.ini, *after* other MakeMaker plugins
        [MakeMaker::Highlander]

DESCRIPTION
    The vast majority of distributions do not need this and should not use
    it. It is intended for distributions that are bundled with
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker in order to bootstrap it.

    This plugin sets the "UNINST" attribute to 1, to ensure that any other
    copies of the module files are removed from @INC. It only runs on Perls
    before v5.12 when @INC was reordered, and only if there appears to be no
    use of "INSTALL_BASE" or "PREFIX".

    This will result in warnings from old ExtUtils::MakeMaker, but appears
    to work nonetheless.

    If a build system already accounts for ExtUtils::MakeMaker's
    pathological bundling and "UNINST = 1" causes problems, the
    "PERL_NO_HIGHLANDER" environment variable may be set to a true value.
